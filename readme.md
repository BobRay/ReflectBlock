ReflectBlock is a plugin for MODx Revolution that blocks, and logs, requests containing the word reflect. Many evildoers scan sites looking for the old reflect snippet that was a minor security vulnerability in older versions of MODX.

Using the information in the log, you can create rules for your .htaccess file that will block the worst offenders permanently.
